# MinimalUB
## Just a minimal (_in my opinion_) utility userbot with:
* Anilist
* LastFM
* Executor (eval and term)
* GDrive
* Download from DDLs / Upload
* Sudo
* Advanced YTDL
* Telegraph
* Speedtest
* Translator and Romaji converter
* Custom Plugins Support
* Etc ~~useful~~ tools

## Requirements
* MongoDB URL
* Telegram API keys
* Python
* Bot Token

## Credits
* Heavily inspired from [Userge](https://github.com/UsergeTeam/Userge) and [USERGE-X](https://github.com/code-rgb/USERGE-X) (ngl it's almost copy pasting)
* [iYTDL](https://github.com/iytdl/iytdl) for Advanced YTDL

## Why did I made this?
Well Userge and USERGE-X (my fav) are one of the best and most powerfull userbots I came across, but sadly they are often targeted by heroku.<br>
So it's just me making a lite version of these userbots including the features I liked and used the most with some personal tweaks.<br>
Both of the above mentioned userbots are actually same, but USERGE-X was tweaked and better version of Userge (_in my opinion_), sadly archived and not getting updates anymore.
